      <!-- Question 1 -->
      <div class="shadow-lg p-6 rounded-lg bg-white">
        <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">How long does it take to see results?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          While the journey to thought leadership is ongoing, many of our clients begin to see significant traction within 3-6 months, with major opportunities often presenting themselves within the first year.
        </p>

      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <div class="shadow-lg p-6 rounded-lg bg-white">
        <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">How much time will I need to commit to this program?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          To get the most out of the program, we recommend setting aside 5-10 hours per week for content creation, coaching sessions, and related activities. However, we understand the demanding nature of healthcare leadership and will work with you to create a schedule that fits your lifestyle.

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <div class="shadow-lg p-6 rounded-lg bg-white">
        <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">What if I'm not comfortable with public speaking or social media?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Many of our most successful clients started out with these concerns. Our program is designed to build your skills and confidence gradually. We'll work at your pace and focus on the platforms and methods that feel most authentic to you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 4 -->
      <div class="shadow-lg p-6 rounded-lg bg-white">
        <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">How is this different from hiring a PR firm?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          While PR is a component of thought leadership, our program goes much deeper. We focus on developing your unique insights, creating substantial content, building lasting industry relationships, and creating a long-term legacy. Our goal is not just to get you press, but to position you as a true leader and innovator in healthcare.
